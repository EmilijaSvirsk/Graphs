# Graphs

Exercise to learn graph data structure and Dijkstra algorithm written in C.

Task:
There is a given list of roads - city1, city2, distance. Find the shortest path from one city to another and its specific length. 
Include exceptions where a path does not exist.

Example (first line indicates the number of cities and roads, last line - the searched path):\
6 8\
0 1 5\
0 2 2\
0 5 1\
1 5 3\
1 3 1\
2 3 9\
